# Project-Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe project from The Odin Project focuses on building a simple yet functional game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It emphasizes modular code design, factory functions, and the module pattern. Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
